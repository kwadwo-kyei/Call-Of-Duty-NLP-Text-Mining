# Call-Of-Duty-NLP-Text-Mining
## Scenario
You’re an up and coming analytics professional working at a digital marketing agency.  Your bosses rely on your excellent analytical skills, business acumen and innovative methods to help their clients.  The marketing firm represents the Call of Duty League, an e-sports league with unique teams and players. The League is exploring adding a new team, the “Cleveland Fire”, and wants to understand any themes related to existing teams’ social media success as well as the current state of the League’s social media presence.  

During client meetings, these questions emerged as a starting point but you are free to explore the data in your own manner, addressing one, all or none of below:
-	Some teams/players/followers may be antagonistic (negative) or display varying emotions.  Can these be compared?
-	Are there natural topics that emerge among all teams, players, or followers or are any distinctive?
-	Can social media analytics help measure the volume of specific terms like “gg” or “good game” (or other specific gaming terms)?  
-	Conversations related to the league, competitions, mentions of a competitor league called “Warzone” would be of interest
-	Basic technical issues/glitches that represent product issues or improvement

## Approach
Out of 9 possible teams to use in my Analysis, I decided to use 3 random e-sport teams for my analysis and decided to analyze the team tweets and team followers tweets to investigate if there is a positive or negative relationship between the tweets of teams and it's twitter followers.
I used different types of text mining methodologies:
- Word Frequencies
- Word Cloud
- Sentiments
- polarity Compassion Cloud
- Emotional Comparison Cloud
